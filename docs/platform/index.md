# What is FEDML Nexus AI?



FEDML® stands for **_F_**oundational **_E_**cosystem **_D_**esign for **_M_**achine **_L_**earning. [FEDML Nexus AI](https://nexus.fedml.ai) is the next-gen cloud service for LLMs & Generative AI. It helps developers to *launch* complex model *training*, *deployment*, and *federated learning* anywhere on decentralized GPUs, multi-clouds, edge servers, and smartphones, *easily, economically, and securely*.

Highly integrated with [FEDML open source library](https://github.com/fedml-ai/fedml), FEDML Nexus AI provides holistic support of three interconnected AI infrastructure layers: user-friendly MLOps, a well-managed scheduler, and high-performance ML libraries for running any AI jobs across GPU Clouds.

A typical workflow is showing in figure above. When developer launch a pre-built job in Studio or Job Store, the job package is shipped into FEDML®Launch to search for the most economical GPU resources 

FEDML decouples AI infra into : 1. MLOps layer, where FEDML®Studio and FEDML®Job Store provides low-code machine learning user experience to democratize LLM and generative AI Applications; 2. Scheduler layer, where FEDML®Launch swiftly pairs AI jobs with the most economical GPU resources, auto-provisions, and effortlessly runs the job, eliminating complex environment setup and management; 3. Compute layer, where 
released FedML's own LLM and other generative AI models; 2. MLOps: FedML® LLM Studio, FedML® FL Studio, GenAI Ops; 3. Compute Framework: FedML® Serve, FedML® Train, FedML® Federate; .



- **FEDML® Launch** is a simple launcher for running any AI job across multiple public and/or decentralized GPU clouds, offering lower prices without cloud vendor lock-in, the highest GPU availability, training across distributed low-end GPUs, and user-friendly Ops to save time on environment setup.
- **FEDML® Launch**

- **FEDML® Deploy** is a model serving platform for high scalability and low latency.
