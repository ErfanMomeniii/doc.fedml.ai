# Overview


FEDMLÂ®Federate FA supports industrial grade of cross-silo federated analytics for cross-organization/account analytics. 
Researchers and engineers do not need to maintain the complex geo-distributed clusters.
Essentially, Our MLOps can seamlessly migrate the local development to the real-world edge-cloud deployment without code changes. 

FedML Octopus supports [diverse communication backends](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/python/fedml/core/distributed/communication), including MQTT+S3, MQTT, PyTorch RPC, gRPC, and MPI.
These communication backends meet the different demands for high-performance, low latency, and robust connection.
